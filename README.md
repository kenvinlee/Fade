Fade was created in the span of 2 months as a project for CSC404: Video Game Design at the University of Toronto. The course put together a group of 8 students - 6 Computer Science students from UofT and 2 Artists from OCAD - to put together a functional alpha game for Toronto's LevelUp Showcase. 

Fade is a 3D Puzzle Adventure game featuring a time stop mechanic. The levels are set in darkness, with the player controlling a circle of light that expands around him. Objects in the game come to life when touching the player's light, and become inactive again when they are back in the darkness. The player must use this mechanic to solve myriad puzzles to clear each level and prevent the game world from fading completely.
